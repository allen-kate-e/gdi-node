# Server-Side Development with Node.js, MongoDB and Express.js

This is an Intro to Node.js course for GDI Boston. The course will be taught in 4 two-hour sections with an optional installation night. Course materials drawn from [An Absolute Beginner's Guide to Node](http://blog.modulus.io/absolute-beginners-guide-to-nodejs), Max Ogden's [Art of Node](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node), and my brain. Thanks to Cheri Allen's [gdi-ruby](https://github.com/cherimarie/gdi-ruby) curriculum for the template for this readme.

## Course description

Interested in Node.js, but don't know where to start or how to find time to learn it properly? Want to create web applications using JavaScript on both the front and back end? Want to create your first API? Curious how it's even possible to run JavaScript outside of the browser?

[Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node) is an open source project that powers applications and products like Netflix, Uber, LinkedIn, and the New York Times. It is a JavaScript environment designed for asynchronous I/O (input/output)

### Dates:
This class takes place over four consecutive Tuesday evenings, as follows:
 - November 10th - 6:30pm to 8:30pm
 - November 17th - 6:30pm to 8:30pm
 - November 24th  - 6:30pm to 8:30pm
 - December 1st - 6:30pm to 8:30pm

There is also an optional installation night on Monday, November 9th from 6:30 to 7:30pm.

### Prereqs & preparation:

This will be a very hands on class, so an intermediate understanding of JavaScript is required. 

Please bring along a laptop and charger as well as have the following programs installed prior to arriving:
 - A text editor. We recommend [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) (free; available for Mac, PC, and Linux).
